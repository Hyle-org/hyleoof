# Hyl√© Oof

Small demo app for the hyle AMM, using [yew](https://yew.rs/)

### Installation

If you don't already have it installed, it's time to install Rust: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.
The rest of this guide assumes a typical Rust installation which contains both `rustup` and Cargo.

To compile Rust to WASM, we need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.
If you don't already have it, install it with the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Now that we have our basics covered, it's time to install the star of the show: [Trunk].
Simply run the following command to install it:

```bash
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```

That's it, we're done!

### Running

#### Frontend

- **React (Vite):**

```bash
cd web-react/
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

- **Rust (Yew) [DEPRECATED]:**

```bash
cd crates/ui
trunk serve
```

Rebuilds the app whenever a change is detected and runs a local server to host it.

There's also the `trunk watch` command which does the same thing but without hosting it.

#### Backend

```sh
cargo run -p server
```

Note: You need to have the [hyle](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle) repo in the parent directory.
